Both Taia have worked hard, faced some challenging personal issues,
and unfortunately their just  rewards will take time.  
Since school Taia has been in the workplace and resumed studies and has been admitted to the bar which is never easy
and has also had to deal with the death of her father and stepfather.
Tris has had to deal with the death of James and working in China and
learning Mandarin which is not eot be underestimated.  On top a PhD, not matter what the initial enthusiams becomes a
is  hard relentless effort but often is hard to raise the degree of empathy that the effort deserves.
I am sure that both Tris and Taias efforts will be rewarded in the long term.  Lets hope that is not too long.

We all depend on our friends, brothers and sisters and parents for support both physical and emotional.
But most critical of all is our spouse and partner, who we will find that we depend on more than anyone else.
As separate and different people our spouse has his or her own issues and probolems
so  a wife or husband can have  a lot to tolerate and much to adapt to.
But the benefits should be mutual and making the effort is amply rewarded.
